# used-car-data
Using python, I created a simple histogram and scatterplot to show the correlation between year and price from a sample of used car prices.

Relative to year, the value of a used car depreciates. Our sample contains cars of varying automatic and manual suspensions, year of car, prices in Lahk,mileage and fuel type.
